Isomorphic i18n
===============

Hello everybody! This is a talk about the possibility to create a server- and
client-side solution for localization and internationalization.

It's going to be fun!

## Talk

The [Reveal.JS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) presentation can
easily be started using [npm and Node.js](http://nodejs.org). To
start everything simply run:

    npm install
    npm start

## Demo: Spring MVC

We provide a demo, a simple Spring MVC application, as an example of
how server-side and client-side i18n can be set up to work together.

The demo application is built using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) and
[Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/),
and uses an embedded [Jetty](http://eclipse.org/jetty/) web server. You
should be able to compile and run it, with the command below, and then browse
to the host and port number that was printed on the command line.

    mvn jetty:run

Good luck!
